# Data Structure & Algorithm Visualizer

> An interactive educational tool for visualizing data structures and sorting algorithms in real-time using **Python** and **Pygame**

**A comprehensive platform for learning fundamental computer science concepts through step-by-step animated demonstrations.**

## 🎯 Overview

This visualizer is designed to help students, developers, and educators understand how data structures work and how algorithms execute. By providing interactive, real-time visualizations, it transforms abstract concepts into tangible, observable processes—making complex computer science fundamentals accessible and engaging.

## ✨ Features

### **Data Structures**
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular implementations
- **Queues**: Standard and Circular queue visualizations
- **Heaps**: Min Heap and Max Heap implementations
- **Stack**: Push, Pop, and Peek operations
- **Binary Tree**: Tree structure visualization and traversals

### **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Bubble Sort**: Visualization of the bubble sort algorithm
- **Selection Sort**: Step-by-step selection sort with ascending/descending modes
- **Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort algorithm animation
- **Merge Sort**: Complete merge sort execution with tree visualization

### **Interactive Controls**
- **Play/Pause**: Control animation speed
- **Step Navigation**: Move forward and backward through algorithm steps
- **Reset**: Restart the visualization anytime
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between different sorting modes (e.g., ascending/descending)
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface with organized menu system

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python** 3.13.5 or higher
- **Pygame** 2.6.1

## 🚀 Installation

## 🎮 How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Run `python main.py` to launch the application
2. Select from the main menu: **Data Structures** or **Algorithms**

### Navigating Data Structures
Browse through organized categories:
- **Linked Lists** – Singly, Doubly, and Circular implementations
- **Queues** – Standard and Circular queue operations

- **Stack** – Push, Pop, and stack operations
- **Binary Tree** – Tree structures and traversals

Each visualization demonstrates:
- How elements are stored and organized
- Operations performed on the data structure
- Memory relationships and node connections

### Navigating Sorting Algorithms
Select any sorting algorithm to visualize the complete execution:
- Watch each comparison and swap in real-time
- Understand the algorithm's decision-making process
- Compare efficiency across different algorithms

### Playback Controls
Control the visualization with these interactive buttons:

| Button | Function |
